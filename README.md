# pythonlearninglessons
Here I will put the lessons I learn in my class on python
I am a learning PEH and learning the basics of coding and wanted somewhere to keep it all.
Most of this will be very beginner and basic. I am always open to feedback that will help me get better. But please keep in mind this is beginner level as I have
only done some basic html before this
